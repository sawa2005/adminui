# Portfolio Admin UI

Admin UI created to manage portfolio data via a REST API and database.

## Description

This admin UI was created as part of the final project of a university course called Web Development III. It manages data for my portfolio with a visual UI through a
CRUD REST API also created (repository called restprojekt). Just like the REST API it was based on a simpler administrative UI created for a earlier assignment in the
same course. The use of the UI is quite simple, after passing the login simply use the on-screen fields and buttons to manage the data in the database.
